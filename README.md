# Question-Queue

This is a program I designed at iD Tech to make it easier for my students to ask me questions. Instead of having to keep their hand raised for a long time, distracting them from work and sometimes distracting me from helping other students, they can describe their problem and put it in a queue where they can wait their turn while contiuing to try to fix their problem themselves. 
This queue was build with node.js websockets. Shoutout to Bootstrap for easy formatting for this one-day project.
